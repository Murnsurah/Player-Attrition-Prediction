## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following tools and libraries:

- **Python**: Programming language used for development
- **FastAPI**: Framework for building the API
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for model training
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations
- **Joblib**: Library for model serialization



## Usage

1. Run the FastAPI server:
uvicorn main:app --reload

Then open your browser and go to  http://127.0.0.1:8000.

2. Send a POST request to the /predict endpoint with transaction data in the following format:
{
	"level_id": 1,
	"attempt_result": 10,
	"attempt_duration": 20.5,
	"f_reststep": 0.5,
	"extra_help_used": 6,
	"avg_attempt_duration": 10.5,
	"avg_clearance_rate": 12.5,
	"avg_clearance_duration": 20.5,
	"avg_num_retries": 8.6,
	"year":Â 2020
}
3. Receive a response with churn prediction and probability:
{
    {
  "churn_prediction": true,
  "churn_probability": 0.65
}
}

## Features
- Simple and effective fraud detection using supervised learning techniques.
- RESTful API built with FastAPI for easy integration.
- Detailed logging of predictions and transactions.
- Well-structured codebase that allows for easy modifications and enhancements.
